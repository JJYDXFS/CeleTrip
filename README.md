## CeleTrip (Celebrity Trip Detection Framework)
This is the source code for paper 'Where Did the President Visit Last Week? Detecting Celebrity Trips from News Articles'.

## Celebrity Trip Dataset
We provide a real-word celebrity trip dataset in file `Celebrity Trip Dataset`. We collecte the trips of 26 politicians and 24 artists from January 2016 to February 2021 from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), and obtain the date and locations. Afterwards, we crawl 2,617,548 news URLs from 01/2016 to 02/2021 from [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/), and get news articles using URLs from [Newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper). We label trip locations and non-trip locations from the news articles, using the ground truth trip locations of celebrities provided by Wikipedia.

## Getting Started

### Prepare data

You can download the dataset from the link [google driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bdD3hkuTm2Z92pNX5_ryX2IZsiLPuV-5?usp=sharing). We provide a sample of our dataset.

| Celebrity | Location | Date | Article | Label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Donald Trump | Langley | 2017-01-21 | ['Trump bring politic to the CIA .', "WASHINGTON — member of the national security community react with shock on Saturday after President Donald Trump ’s inaugural visit to CIA headquarters in which he use a speech in front of the agency 's memorial to attack the medium and his critic .", ... ] | True |
